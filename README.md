# Workforce-Scheduling-Optimizer

A Machine Learning + Optimization system that generates optimal staff schedules for multiple industries (Hospital, Call Center, Retail).

🚀 Overview

This project is a generalized workforce scheduling engine that combines:

Synthetic data generation

Machine learning demand forecasting

Constraint-based optimization (Google OR-Tools)

Interactive Streamlit dashboard

Industry-specific configurations

The engine supports multiple industries with different rules and constraints, including:

🏥 Hospitals (nurses, doctors, skill levels, shift rules)

☎️ Call Centers (hourly call demand, break rules, shift templates)

🛒 Retail Stores / Supermarkets (customer flow, manager presence, weekend boosts)

The system produces optimized weekly schedules that respect employee constraints and minimize understaffing.

🎯 Project Objectives

Build a realistic operations research solution that companies actually use.

Apply machine learning and optimization modeling to real scheduling problems.

Create a tool that works for multiple industries (generalizable design).

Provide a clean, professional project suitable for internship applications.

🧠 Features
✔ Synthetic dataset generator

Automatically creates realistic datasets for:

Hourly demand

Employee profiles

Skill levels

Constraints

✔ Multi-industry configuration

Each industry has its own JSON constraint file.

✔ Machine Learning (Forecasting Module)

Predicts:

staffing demand

productivity adjustments

daily peak hours

✔ Scheduling Optimizer

Uses OR-Tools to respect:

max weekly hours

rest times

skill requirements

preferred shifts

night shift rules

weekend fairness

✔ Streamlit Interface

Upload any dataset

Choose industry

Run optimization
